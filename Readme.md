# MailSender API Documentation

MailSender API Documentation is a comprehensive guide that provides developers with the necessary information to integrate the MailSender API into their applications. This API allows you to send emails programmatically using either the sender's credentials or an API key for authentication.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow the instructions below to integrate the MailSender API into your application.

### Prerequisites

Before using the MailSender API, ensure you have:

- Node.js installed on your server or development environment.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/mailsender-api.git
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   cd mailsender-api
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

#### Sender's Credentials

To send an email using the sender's credentials, make a `POST` request to `/mailsender` with the following JSON payload:

```json
{
  "SUBJECT": "Hello",
  "MESSAGE": "This is a test email.",
  "MAIL_ID": "your_email@gmail.com",
  "MAIL_PASSWORD": "your_email_password",
  "SEND_TO": "recipient@example.com"
}
```

#### API Key

To send an email using an API key for authentication, make a `POST` request to `/mailsender/{API_KEY}` with the following JSON payload:

```json
{
  "SEND_TO": "recipient@example.com",
  "SUBJECT": "Hello",
  "MESSAGE": "This is a test email."
}
```

### Responses

#### Success:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
